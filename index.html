    <h1><b>THE SPORT</b></h1>
    <p>Soccer, also known as football in most countries, is the world's most popular sport. Played by two teams of 11
        players, the objective is to score by getting the ball into the opponent's goal using any part of the body
        except the hands and arms. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end, and it's governed
        by the rules of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).</p>

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Ancient Origins</h3>
            <p>Forms of soccer-like games date back to ancient civilizations. One of the earliest documented versions
                comes from China around the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC, known as "Cuju" (meaning "kick the ball"). Cuju
                was played with a leather ball filled with feathers, and the aim was to kick the ball into a net.</p>

            <h3>Modern Soccer Takes Shape</h3>
            <p>Modern soccer began to take its current form in England in the mid-19th century. Various schools and
                universities had their own versions of the game, but in 1863, the formation of the Football Association
                (FA) in London formalized the sport. This is considered the official birth of soccer as we know it
                today. The FA established standard rules, distinguishing soccer from rugby, which allowed players to use
                their hands. British sailors, merchants, and workers played a crucial role in spreading the game to
                Europe, South America, and beyond. By the late 19th century, soccer clubs had formed across Europe and
                South America, most notably in Italy, Spain, Argentina, and Brazil.</p>
